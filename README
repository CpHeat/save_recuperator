To use this script, you must create a games.json file.
Games will be split in two types: those who have their savefile in a subfolder of Users/[your_username] (listed under "user_related") and those who don't (listed under "public").
You should fill the json file like this:

game_title: purely cosmetic, it will be shown in the logs
for user_related games:
location_start: the first half of the location for the files, that comes before your username (it will most likely be C:/Users/)
location_end: the last half of the location for the files, that comes after your username
folder: the name of the folder itself that contains all the save/configuration files
for public games:
location: the full location of the files
folder: the name of the folder itself that contains all the save/configuration files

{
  "user_related": {
    "game_title" : {
      "location_start" : "location_start",
      "location_end" : "location_end",
      "folder": "folder"
    },
    "game_example" : {
      "location_start" : "C:/Users/",
      "location_end" : "/AppData/Roaming/Saves/",
      "folder": "steamid"
    }
  },
  "public": {
    "game_title" : {
      "location" : "full_location",
      "folder": "folder"
    }
  }
}

At launch the script will ask for your username (as seen in C:\Users) to complete the location of the files. Then you can select import or export.
